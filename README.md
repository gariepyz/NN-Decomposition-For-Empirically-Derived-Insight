This repository provides the code used for my publication "Machine-Learning-Driven High-Entropy Alloy Catalyst Discovery to Circumvent the Scaling Relation for CO2 Reduction Reaction"
ACS Catal. 2022, 12, 24, 14864â€“14871 (https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c03675)

This notebook provides a first ever look into the intermediate rotation mechanic observed on HEAs.

This mechanic is then used as a design principle to create some of the best CO2RR catalytic surfaces in computational literature. The key lies in splitting key potential limiting steps into smaller steps through rotational reconfiguration.

There are 2 notebooks and accompanying files/datasets in this repository:

1: 'Neural_Net_Decomposition_Method'is the main notebook outlining how to train a basic NN model with TF, extract internal weights, and perform a NN decomposition outlined in the publication.

2: 'Visualization_and_exploration_of_Dataset' is a supplementary notebook providing data visualization for the figures provided in the publication.

3: 'helpers.py' is a python file with a classes for feature embedding and the NN decomposition.

4: 'All_data.csv' and 'site_infs.csv' contain the raw dataset data generated through DFT and neural generators.

Required Python Packages to run the code:
pandas,
numpy,
matplotlib,
seaborn,
math,
tensorflow,
sklearn
